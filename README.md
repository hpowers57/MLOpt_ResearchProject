# CSCI 6968 Research Project
## Models
List file(s) where model(s) are implemented. Include a brief description of the architectures and (for models taken from papers) a reference for the paper it came from.

## Data
Either a folder with the pre-processed data or a file which collects and pre-processes the data. Include a brief description of the dataset(s) included.

## Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated by their RMSE, R-squared, optimism ratio, and pessimism ratios. THe implementation for the optimism and pessimism ratios can be found in `evaluation_metrics.py`. The optimism and pessimism ratios are defined by Sethia & Raut (2018).

## Experiments
File which trains and tests the model(s) for the datasets above and compiles the results tables.
