# CSCI 6968 Research Project
## Models
All models are currently implemented in `models.py`. The current models include:
- Martingale (Elliot et al, 2017)
- RNN
- GRU
- LSTM

All RNN models are implemented with Torch.

## Data
Data is collected from Yahoo Finance with `pull_data` in `data.py`. Currently, we use the prices for Apple from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2020. The data is split into bins and training and testing sets with `make_train_test`.

## Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated by their RMSE, R-squared, optimism ratio, and pessimism ratios. THe implementation for the optimism and pessimism ratios can be found in `evaluation_metrics.py`. The optimism and pessimism ratios are defined by Sethia & Raut (2018).

## Experiments
The models above are trained and evaluated in `experiments.ipynb`.
